For each task there is a branch with a start tag on it. Check out the desired branch for the task you want to start
using the start tag.

This file will be replaced by a description of the task to do. One possible solution is done on the branch and merged
back to `master` before the next task branch starts. So you can have a look on it switching to the next branch start tag
or simple switch the branch in the _github_ browser to see the next task in this file and going on with your code.

Checkout branch `task-1` at tag `start-1`â€¦
