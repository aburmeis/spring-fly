Use a profile

Create a profile _memory_ and move the current services to that profile only

Tips:

* add `@Profile` to the desired components
* `@ActiveProfile` selects profiles to be used for Spring based tests
* use the environment of the `ConfigurableApplicationContext` to select a profile in production
