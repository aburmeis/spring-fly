Task 11
-------

Create a form view controller to search for airport by code or airports by country. Offer a drop down to select a country for search.

Tips:

* create a new form controller (no REST!) using `AirportRegistry` with a mapping for `/index`
* return a `ModelAndView`, create a HTML view in `resources/templates`
* add [thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/2.1/thymeleafspring.html) to your dependencies: `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`
